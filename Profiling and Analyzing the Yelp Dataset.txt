Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = id-10000
ii. Hours = business_id-1562
iii. Category = business_id -2643 
iv. Attribute = business_id - 1115
v. Review = id - 10000
vi. Checkin = business_id - 493
vii. Photo = id - 10000, business_id - 6493
viii. Tip = user_id - 537, business_id - 3979
ix. User = id - 10000
x. Friend = user_id - 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id - 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: NO
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
		SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM user
		WHERE id IS NULL

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes, they mostly open around lunch time and with one restaurant opens around dinner. One restaurant close before dinner and the rest close at 11 pm.   

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

The difference is not that noticeable as the two extreme number of review of restaurants got the lower number of reviews. While those at the middle got more reviews. 


         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
People in Toronto tend to have extreme opinion on Japanese style dishes while western style meals tend to accomodate thier taste. 

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT 
		b.name,
		b.city,
		c.category,
		h.hours,
		b.review_count,
		CASE
			WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
			WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
		END AS star_rating
FROM (business AS b INNER JOIN category AS c ON b.id = c.business_id)
INNER JOIN hours AS h ON h.business_id = b.id
WHERE b.city = 'Toronto'
AND c.category LIKE '%Restaurants%'
GROUP BY b.stars
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

By average, businesses which are open tend to have more reviews than the close ones. 
		
			Open:   avg_review_count = 31.757
			Closed: avg_review_count = 23.198
			
ii. Difference 2:
Those businesses which are open tend to have more stars than those which are closed 
	
			Open:   avg_star = 3.679
			Closed: avg_star = 3.520
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT AVG(review_count) AS avg_review_count, AVG(stars) AS avg_star, is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
		Finding commonalities of business establishments that is either open or close to predict factors that contributed to thier  by examining the sentiments and reviews of the customers. 
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
			Common sentiments of customers will help businesses enhance their services to avoid closures in the future and insure their business will stay open. 
		The data to be considered will be from both those business which already closed and stay open to have a glimpse on what contributed to their failure or success.
			Data to be considered in this analysis will be name, city, stars, whether its open or not, and the comments of the customers. 
		With this data, we would be able to see patterns among businesses that lead to their closures or what makes them still open as of the moment. 
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

I am a die-hard fan of Robert's in Tucson but this is the first place that gives them a run for their money.  Homemade thick slabs of bread served with fresh strawberry jam and an egg scramble with spinach and havarti = breakfast heaven.  This place is tiny and I'm sure gets packed as we went on a Tuesday morning and there was a small wait but it's so worth it!                                                                                                                                                                                            |

It can get really crowded, which makes standing really tedious and plants a target on your big forehead for the leprechaun to abuse.  On St. Paddy's Day, this place is chaos, and like most other forced holidays is not worth getting into the carnival atmosphere just to say you did it.  Cash-only holidays get old in a hurry. |

We tried the spicy chicken and it was kind of dry.  They give a lot of french fries so we didn't need to order two entrees with fries but instead ordered one entree with fries and added additional chicken pieces and it was enough to feed three of us.  It's a cheap meal located in a residential neighborhood.  Definitely off the beaten path for us tourist.  The nata was ok.  It would have tasted better if they served it warm or at least at room temp.                                                                     |

These days the only reason I come here is to make my mortgage payment. Saturday morning, I was the only one in line. For 10 minutes while a teller conversed with a customer about their grandkids. I get it you want to connect with your customers. Another person working the drive thru  came to the front where I thought he would help me. No such luck. Finally, a woman from the back came out and asked if I had a check deposit or a payment. She finally took my payment. One more reason to hate the big banks.                        |

We went for lunch and our waitress kept in mind that we were on a tight schedule.  Husband thought his sandwich was ok, priced right but nothing special.  The hit of this place, as many have said, is the homemade pies!  Save room for a slice, very tasty!

The tacos are good, I had one of each, very unique!  The Beast burrito is my favorite! The ceviche was tasty, but almost too chunky so it was hard to scoop on a chip.

We ordered the candied bacon, pot roast fries, a president salad (which was just a chicken Caesar salad) and the model turkey sandwich. Candied bacon was good, I liked the flavor a lot, not too sweet. The fries were very good as well - they gave a generous portion of the pot roast.

Just a mishmash of good ingredients ruined by poor creativty. I mean, they screwed up the bread and butter! Why not just give out some fresh simple rolls and fresh butter instead of the tough (not crusty)  sun dried tomato and herb roll with garlic and pine nut butter. Poor texture on top of too many flavors that didn't really match up well. Yuck!

Pricing wasn't horrible, selection was better than average, cashiers, hostesses and waitstaff were pleasant and attentive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
